## Who are you? 
My name is Jayson, I have been working in Devops and Software development for a little over 5 years (at the time of this writing anyways...)
I have a Degree in Information Technology and just generally like tech and nerd stuff. I started writing this blog to help me explore new technologies and avenues of software, 
but also as a way to help retain knowledge and showcase what I know.

## What is this blogs main focus? 
Devops, of course. AWS has always had a good definition: 

https://aws.amazon.com/devops/what-is-devops/

> DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organizationâ€™s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity: 
> evolving and improving products at a faster pace than organizations using traditional software development and infrastructure management processes. This speed enables 
> organizations to better serve their customers and compete more effectively in the market.

So in a nutshell, Devops practices can help move work quicker while reducing risk. 

With that being said, Devops encompasses a lot of tools, practices, and knowledge these days. I will write about things like: 

 - CI/CD pipelines (from dev to production)
 - Scripting in Python, Bash and Powershell
 - Infrastructure tools and their usage
 - Cloud technologies and features
 - Software practices and philosophies
 - Containers
 - Emerging technologies in Devops
 
The list goes on.
